EXACT-Med (Experimental actions (medical)) ontology aims to provide a model for the representation of
protocols in medical laboratories. Such an explicit computational model is important for ensuring
reproducibility of experimental procedures, facilitating experimental data exchange, and supporting
automation. The ontology can also be used for the development of software applications ranging from
mobile applications for training and quality control purposes to complex decision support systems.
