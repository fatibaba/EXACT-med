EXACT-Med (Experimental actions (medical)) ontology has been renamed to OCL-SOP (Ontology for Clinical Laboratory Standard Operating Procedures). The latest version can be found here as OCL-SOP.owl. This ontology aims to provide a model for the representation of
protocols in clinical laboratories. Such an explicit computational model is important for ensuring
reproducibility of experimental procedures, facilitating experimental data exchange, and supporting
automation.
