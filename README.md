EXACT-Med (Experimental actions (medical)) ontology has been renamed to OCL-SOP (Ontology for Clinical Laboratory Standard Operating Procedures). The latest version can be found here as OCL-SOP.owl. This ontology aims to provide a model for the representation of protocols in clinical laboratories. Such an explicit computational model is important for ensuring reproducibility of experimental procedures, facilitating experimental data exchange, and supporting automation. 
OCL-SOP extends EXperimental ACTions (EXACT) ontology by reusing all its terms and adding new ones pertinent to clinical laboratory standard operating procedures. 

To use OCL-SOP download the following 6 files:
1. OCL-SOP.owl
2. EXACT.owl
3. obi-import.owl
4. obi-rel.owl
5. pato-import.owl
6. ro-import.owl

More updates will be added soon!
